# Brand system architecture

## Decision

The canonical LibreSign brand system lives in this Git repository. The official LibreSign website is the human-facing publication layer. Shared-drive/Nextcloud material is working or historical storage, not the source of truth.

LibreSign has its own product identity and should not depend on the LibreCode website to explain its logo, naming, pronunciation, or public assets.

## Why

Modern brand systems are operational systems: rules, reusable assets, publishing workflows, and governance need to evolve together. Git gives reviewable history, diffs, releases, ownership, and automation that mutable shared folders do not.

For free/open-source projects, copyright licensing and trademark permission must remain explicit and separate. Openly licensing documentation or artwork does not itself grant trademark rights.

## Layers

1. **Canonical source** — this repository.
2. **Public guide** — https://libresign.coop/brand
3. **Generated distributions** — released PDFs and approved exports.
4. **Workspace/archive** — Nextcloud or other shared storage.

## Directory model

- `guidelines/`: normative brand rules.
- `source/`: preferred editable source.
- `assets/`: approved public exports.
- `manual/`: reproducible publication source.
- `examples/`: explanatory examples.
- `archive/`: historical material only.
- `LICENSES/` + `REUSE.toml`: licensing metadata.

## Research basis

- Ribeiro, Raposo, Almendra & Neves, “Design Systems Applied to Visual Identities” (2026): design systems increasingly operate as Brand Visual Language Systems joining directives, assets, modules, and workflows.
- GitLab Brand Guidelines: public guidelines combine logo, color, typography, voice, and asset distribution.
- Mozilla licensing/trademark guidance: open copyright licensing is distinct from trademark rights.
- Pamela Chestek, *Open Source Law, Policy and Practice*, chapter on trademarks (2022): FOSS projects should explicitly define ownership, community use, and trademark governance.
- REUSE Specification 3.3: file-level, machine-readable licensing and copyright metadata.

## Manual publication

PDF is a release artifact, not canonical source. Issue #3 tracks the decision between Typst, LaTeX, and Pandoc-based workflows.

## Migration rule

Do not revoke historical public links until every unique source and approved asset has been inventoried, migrated, licensed, and validated.
