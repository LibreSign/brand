# Canonical artwork source

Store current canonical editable artwork here.

- prefer SVG;
- strip unnecessary editor metadata;
- do not store duplicate raster exports as source;
- generate PNG/PDF derivatives in CI;
- preserve SPDX/REUSE coverage.

Third-party fonts, if vendored, must keep their upstream license.
